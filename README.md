# “Hapyness” Share it through music.
what music is associated with positive sentiment and sharing positive and uplifting messages on social media
## Abstract

People that is happy likes to share it throuhg social media either a picture on instagram with your friends or a tweet about a song that you really like and is making you feel great.
In this project we will focus on the second scenario, we want to find what type of music is related to a positive sentiment and how this is related with the sharing of positive and uplifting messages on social media.
The datasets that we will be using are "twitter" as the social media platform and "millionsong" as the music database.


## Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
The questions we would like to address are:

* Can we use extra datasets to train our model, for example labeled positive or negative tweets from kaggle?
* How to identify the genre, artis, or name of the song on a tweet.
* How to distinguish "happy" music in a quantitive way?



## Dataset
* Tweets dataset.

1. Exploration and cleaning of data, to find if there are problems with the data so that we can handle them.
2. Determine keywords related to positive tweets. 
3. Use ML techniques to classify and filter tweets found on previous step to create the model.


* MillionSong dataset

1. Relate the keywords found in the tweet data set with the genre of the song, in the dataset the genre is the “term” field.
2. Analyze the energy and danceability of the song for each suspected mention on a tweet and determine if belongs to the "positive" category.
