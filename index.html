        Music is a crucial element of everyday life and human culture. People spend several hours listening to it
        and
        lots of money acquiring it. “… Whenever humans come together for any reason, music is there,” writes Daniel
        Levitin “….weddings, funerals, graduation from college, men marching off to war, stadium sporting events, a
        night on the town, prayer, a romantic dinner, mothers rocking their infants to sleep and college students
        studying with music as a background….”
        History tells that very early man developed primitive flutes from animal bones and used stones and wood as
        percussion, producing the first types of music. Voice would have been the first and most natural means of
        expression in our distant ancestors, used to bond socially or comfort a sleepless child. It is from these
        humble
        beginnings that the music we enjoy today evolved.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Today with the explosion of the internet, music Services as Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal and other apps and
        platforms; it has become easier to access,
        obtain and share music. This project aims to analyze the evolution of music since the 2000s in terms of
        songs/genres/artists popularity and preferences, evaluate the key features of the songs, such as energy,
        valence, danceability, and others.
        We aim to show and understand which were the most popular genres in the last years, the most popular songs,
        the
        most important artists and what were the trends of the key features of those hits.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3 id="title2"><b> Dataset</b></h3>
        For this purpose, we'll work with two datasets:

        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01840.pdf">FMA: A Dataset For Music Analysis</a></b>
                Free Music Archive (FMA), is an open and easily accessible music dataset.
                The dataset contains the information of 106,574 tracks from 16,341 artists and 14,854 albums,
                arranged in a hierarchical taxonomy of 161 genres. It provides full-length and high-quality audio,
                pre-computed features, together with the track- and user-level metadata, tags, and free-form text
                such
                as
                biographies. Most useful features from user-level metadata were extracted and used in the current
                analysis.
            </li>

            <br/>
            <li>
                <b><a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify and LastFM API</a></b>
                : It consists of our crawled dataset created using Spotify and LastFM API.
                To complete the previous dataset and extend our analysis to the last years, information from years
                2015-2018 was gathered from Spotify and LastFM API for years 2015-2018.
            </li>
        </ul>

        Both datasets were merged into a one complete dataset containing information for the time interval analyzed
        which
        comprises from the year 2000 to 2018. The results and findings are summarized in the following lines.

        <h3 id="title3"><b> How many songs and albums? </b></h3>

        Music, like all other arts, evolve over the years and dynamically change according to people's interests
        and
        demands. Along
        history, several genres emerged in different periods of time, in most of the cases influenced by the region
        of
        origin and particular events occurring at that time. The decade of the 2000s, characterized by the
        increasing
        interests in internet technologies and social media mark a very important milestone in human's history and
        for
        sure must have some impact on music evolution. In the following years, such technological evolution
        continues with the explosion of streaming and cloud
        services, and portable and smart devices, which definitely impacts how people access and consumes music
        and will definitely impact their preferences.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We aim to analyze
        and understand such music evolution, from 2000 to 2018 in terms of quantity, people's preferences, and
        songs
        features. To visually understand the growth of music production/consumption over the years, let's see how
        many tracks and albums were produced every year.

        <br/>
        <br/>

        The production of tracks and albums has increased exponentially over the years and as expected, the
        production of albums is correlated with the production of tracks.
        In the last year (2018), we see a decrement of music production, but it is due to data collection which
        does not collect the whole year but only until October.

        <h3 id="title4"><b> Have you listened to it? </b></h3>

        Song preferences and popularities over the years are difficult to predict and never follow a perfect recipe
        since even "similar" people have different music preferences.
        Usually, popular songs are the catchy, compelling and commercial ones, meaning they are well crafted and
        connect to a broad audience and it causes an action on the part of the listener. It may make them cry,
        laugh,
        dance, tap their feet, go purchase the song, or simply it causes them to react. Exposure to the song may
        also cause them to become more wanted by people, hearing a song enough times makes them "grow on you".
        However, and as stated initially, it is impossible to find specific patterns or rules that make songs
        popular. Let's show how the songs and albums popularity evolved in the analyzed time interval, the way to
        measure popularity is represented by the number of listens in the platforms Spotify/FMA.

        <h3 id="title5"><b> Let's find your favorite artists! </b></h3>

        Artists popularity is closely linked to their song's popularity, in most cases, it can be measured by their
        sales and the number of listens they have. Some artists are able to stay popular for a long time due to
        their constant release of hits, but others have a temporal and short popularity marked by a unique or few
        successes. Do you think your favorite groups/artist will show up in the list of the most popular (highest
        hotness) of the last years? Let's explore the rankings.

        <br/>
        <br/>

        <div class="banner">
            <div class="inline-block">

            </div>

        </div>


        Such ranking coincides with the artists that have the higher number of streams in Spotify and also with
        their number
        of followers.


        <br/>
        <br/>

        <h3 id="title6"><b> How about the trending genres? </b></h3>

        Music genres are conventional categories that identify songs/artists as belonging to a shared tradition or
        set of conventions. Music can be divided into different genres and these classifications are often
        subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. Over the years many new genres have appeared by
        the transformation or influence of other genres. This dynamic behavior, which causes genres popularity to
        change over time, is also generated by fluctuating people's demands and interests. Now, we present an
        interactive visualization which depicts the genre's evolution in the last five years, considering only the
        top
        10 most popular genres. Their popularity (or hotness) is measured by the mean of all artists hotness who
        released songs that year and that belong to that specific genre. Let's explore the results!

            You can explore the genre's popularity, by moving the cursor over the colored areas.
            They represent the top 10 genres (based on song hotness) in the time interval 2013 to 2018.
            The genres are: Rock, Pop, International, Instrumental, Experimental, Easy Listening,
            Country and Blues. The time interval was considered for the last five years, due to genre variability
            over time. For every year, each of the genres is represented by their hotness,
            which is obtained by the mean of all songs hotness released on the specified year.

        <h3 id="title7"><b> Exploring song Features </b></h3>
        The analyzed dataset contains the song's metadata and audio features of each song. How about exploring some
        of
        these features and their evolution over the years? Are they somehow related to genres/artist evolution?
        These features can also help us measure the variations of music during one year, and to achieve higher
        granularity we split the analysis by the season of the year (e.g summer, winter, autumn, and spring). All
        the songs that were released during the same season are grouped together and the mean of their valence,
        energy, and danceability is calculated. Let's explore the results.

        To analyze how song features are related between each other we will plot a 3D kluster analysis,

        <h3 id="title9"><b> Conclusions </b></h3>
        The projet objective was to analyze the evolution of music since 2000, show the most
        popular genres, artists and songs, and see how the keyfeatures changed overtime.
        The resulsts obtained are:
        <ul>
            <li>Most Popular Genre</li>
            Overall the most popular genre on since 2000 is international which may imply that the music plataforms
            such as spotify played an important role breaking the
            frontiers of sharing music.
            This is also shown in the increase of the danceability over the years, and the genre with the highest
            average value is international.
            <li>Most Popular Artists</li>
            The top artists are also related to the genre international, it can be observed in the graph above of
            the top 10 artists that we have international influnce, like Khalid, Cardi B, Maluma, etc.
            <li>Key features evolution</li>
            The key feaures evolution is explained in the previous graphs, summarizing:
            1) Danceability: had a constant increase over the last years, because of the main influence of
            international music <br>
            and the winter is the season with the most danceable songs.
            2) Energy: Has a decrease since 2014, which is according to the increase of the genres with lower
            energy features. The season where
            the energy is the highest is summer. <br>
            3) Valence: Valence had an increase until year 2010 and then a decrease, and the season whit the
            highest valence is winter, as shown before, related with the danceability feature. <br>

        DE LAS ANTERIORES PREGUNTAS YA TENDRIAMOS COMO VARIAN LOS GENEROS/ARTISTAS DURANTE LOS 18 ANHOS (ANHO POR
        ANHO).
        EL BOOM DE LOS STREAMING SERVICES CREO QUE FUE 2014. LO QUE DEBERIA PASAR ES QUE SE INTERNACIONALIZE MAS EL
        CONSUMO DE MUSICA (e.g. SE ESCUCHE MAS MUSICA LATINA O EN ESPANHOL), PODEMOS INTENTAR ENCONTRAR EL ANHO
        DONDE
        HAY ESE CRECIMIENTO.
        BOOM DE YOUTUBE TALVEZ TUVO UN EFECTO EN LA PRODUCCION DE MUSICA Y LA FORMA DE LLEGAR AL PUBLICO..PODEMOS
        VER
        ESOS ANHOS Y TRATAR DE ENCONTRAR ALGO
